### Electronic Document Management (EDM)
EDM (Electronic Document Management) consists of digitally storing document volumes to solve the problems of physical-blood release, extraction and deterioration in paper handling. In addition, the EDM enables a faster search for information.
With EDM systems it is no longer necessary to fetch documents, which is a time-consuming process. Documents are grouped together with a few clicks. If necessary, documents can be accessed from other locations through EDM solutions for Web deployment.
We use EDM companies that have a large volume of documents stored in physical files. The Liquid EDM family has software that enables the scanning, indexing, management and availability of documents on local networks or the Internet.
The Network & Image performs a document scanning and a net indexing, and you can train an internal team of a company to conduct a scanning and indexing of the documents internally. Get to know the Network & Image better.
